# TRAVEL PLANNER APP

[My Travel Planner App](https://travel-planner-api.onrender.com/)

## About
### The purpose of Travel Planner App is to help user managing and planing their trip faster and easier.


Before start coding for the project I created the [project planner](https://github.com/users/tmp03099/projects/1/views/1?layout=board) to keep track of my tasks and make sure that I'm on time. 



This website is created with the [WIREFRAME](https://wireframe.cc/6x7iBE) and [ERD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ypiG4mybDiA9Dnpozdf9xAkw7EYbpP50/view) design diagrams as wireframes for better development.


This project demonstrated my knowledge as a Full-stack developer where I am able to create websites that connected to backend server to save and load information to and from database server. 

While working on this project, I encounted a big issue where I found out that formik is incompatible with Use Effect hook in React.  This issue is causing infinite looping of rendering the component. I spend a lot of time researching and trying different way to address the problem and finnaly found a solution. I learned a lot from this project. With just a week of coding, I was able to provide a working version of the application.  While it is simple, it have enough functionality that allow user to plan their trip.  I will continue to further refining the current features and adding new capabilities further improve this project.


### Main Features
- Allow user login with Authorization. 
- User Information and trips information were stored in database.
- CRUD applied for create, read, update and delete the trip and activities data.
- Used different types of React Hooks. 
- Applied input validation with formik.
- Deploy front end application and back end server using Render.
